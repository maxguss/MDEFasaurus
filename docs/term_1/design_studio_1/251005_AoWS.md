## Poison Pilling

Description: Poison pilling (or data poisoning) is the deliberate insertion of malicious, misleading, or corrupted data into datasets used to train machine learning or AI models. The goal is to “poison” the model’s learning process so it behaves incorrectly, produces biased or nonsensical outputs, or even leaks sensitive data.

This definition was copied from ChatGPT when asked: “Do you know what poison pilling is as it relates to putting in data that messed up ai data training?”

We later asked ChatGPT how it felt about this practice. Here is the conversation.

## Open-Source Sufficiency
Self-sufficiency is often imagined as an individual act, but it has never been true. Every tool, technique, and repair depends on shared knowledge passed between people and across generations.

Open-source sufficiency treats self-sufficiency knowledge as a commons, where tools, repairs, and practices circulate freely so individuals can build resilience together.
