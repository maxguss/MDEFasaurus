# Living With Your Own Ideas

This was a 3-day intensive focusing on the concepts of prothetics, cybernetics, and rapid iterative prototyping.

### Day 1

The core idea is to subvert the gender dysphoria narratives around the hairline for transfemme individuals. Those assigned male at birth (AMAB) frequently have some form of hair loss even in the form of a marginally receded hairline called a widows peak. Even slight deviations in this hairline can be a painful experience for those not looking to identify and express themselves as male. The widows peak often denies transgender women the feeling of being able to match the feminine narratives they subscribe to. My prototype is a prosthesis that breaks down the narrative around this section of the hairline.

Yes, these are horns! By putting prosthetic horns in this contested space, we can create new anti-masculine narratives around ornamentation and self expression. This creates a new opportunity for transfemme individuals to both question their narratives around gender expression and reclaim a part of themselves that they may feel disphoric towards.
