## Hello!

This is my website to document my findings as I explore my way through the Master's in Design for Emergent Futures. This a story and I hope it reads like one. I'll explore things that strike my curiosity in the realms of biology, materiality, speculative fiction, games, and a bunch of other stuff I like! Along the way I'll also have to reflect deeply and hopefully come out of this a better creator, and more importantly, a better human. As this space grows alongside me and I continue to cultivate it, I hope there are things here that that'll spark your interest too!
